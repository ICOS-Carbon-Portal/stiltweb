    "description": "STILT, the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport model, is a Lagrangian particle dispersion model (LPDM) for atmospheric transport. It is used to derive the upstream influence region on atmospheric measurement locations, the so-called footprint. These footprints are combined with surface maps of natural and anthropogenic tracer fluxes, to simulate atmospheric tracer concentrations at stations. Particles are followed 10 days backward in time.",

(2011, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-8-1643-2011) based on soil moisture, soil temperature and soil respiration data produced by JSBACH land ecosystem model.

Emissions are estimated by (i) conversion of FRP observations to the dry matter (DM) consumed by the fire, and (ii) application of emission factors to DM for different biomes, based on field and laboratory studies in the scientific literature, to estimate the emissions.",
